You’ve obviously heard of marketing. Perhaps it was during a class in school or through your friends who work in marketing departments. Or maybe, you’re trying to grow a business or blog. Or, maybe, you just googled ‘What is marketing?’ and still don’t have a clear definition.

I recently went the Google route and some of the favorite definitions that I found are:

‘Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.’ - [American Marketing Association (2016)](https://www.ama.org/Pages/default.aspx)

‘Marketing is the science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit. Marketing identifies unfulfilled needs and desires. It defines, measures and quantifies the size of the identified market and the profit potential. It pinpoints which segments the company is capable of serving best and it designs and promotes the appropriate products and services.’ - [Dr. Philip Kotler](http://www.kotlermarketing.com/phil_questions.shtml)

“Marketing are activities of a company associated with buying and selling a product or service. It includes advertising, selling and delivering products to people.” - [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp)

While all of these are "informative", I don’t think they really clarify what marketing is. [Regis McKenna,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_McKenna) best known for his work with Apple, summed it up concisely with his ‘Marketing is everything,’ statement, although, I don’t think that helped clarify thing either.

There isn’t a precise definition for marketing, but there are a few points that are pretty consistent between definitions. We’ll go into each of these a bit more below.

* Marketing is an art and a science
* Marketing is consumer driven
* Marketing is a conversation
* Marketing is finding ways to drive revenue

### Marketing is art & science.

Gone are the days that creativity ruled in marketing. While innovation is key, marketing has welcomed science into its folds. Now, we can be creative AND offer quantitative results. We can use data to drive our strategies and provide attribution. It’s an amazing world.

### Marketing is consumer driven.

Marketing has moved into the world of meeting consumers needs and wants. We can no longer tell a consumer we need something, but now brands have to listen to consumers, identify a gap in the market and then provide a solution.

### Marketing is a conversation.

Social media has allowed brands and consumers to converse and build a true, lasting relationships. Brands need to find ways to interact with their audience through the use of social channels. Messaging should be consistent and resonate with their audience in a way that encourages them to engage.

### Marketing is finding a way to drive revenue.

All of the above are great, but if your efforts aren’t driving revenue, then it’s not working. Brands have to find a way to resonate with consumers AND move product. Marketing has to find a way to meet the brand’s objectives while still meeting consumer’s needs and wants in a way that resonates with them.

Marketing covers a lot of different things, and it can be confusing without a perfect definition. Our future blog posts will be dedicated to diving deeper into what marketing entails, so stay tuned. And let us know some of your favorite marketing quotes and definitions in the comments below!
