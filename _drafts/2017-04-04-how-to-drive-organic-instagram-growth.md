Instagram seems to be all the rage these days. Every brand, blogger and person seems to be on it, and they’re all fighting for followers, likes, and attention. So, how do you break through the clutter to reach people who will engage with your content? We’ve outlined a few simple steps for you that are sure to increase your followers and engagement!

### Share high quality content

I know, this should go without saying. But, in order for people to follow you or engage with your stuff, it needs to be good. And, having a consistent feed will help you keep your followers and get your engagement up. We love @[cestmaria](http://instagram.com/cestmaria)’s bright backgrounds and minimalistic approach and @[cerealmag](http://instagram.com/cerealmag)'s use of neutral colors.

### Hashtags

Did you know that posts with 11 or more hashtags get the highest engagement rate? Using hashtags can help expose your account to large, targeted audiences, thus enabling to grow your account & engagement. The best way to use hashtags is to use ones that are relevant to your niche, so it’s always good to see what competitors or similar accounts are using.

### Engage With Others

There’s no better way to encourage engagement than to engage. Building a relationship with your followers through Instagram requires liking, commenting and following them back. And, the best way to increase your chance of being discovered is to engage with other accounts within your niche. While this can be time consuming, it’s truly the best way to grow your account.

### Post Consistently

Interestingly enough, accounts with the highest number of fans tend to post 2-3x per day. With Instagram’s new algorithm, the more often you post the more likely you will be to have your account seen.
