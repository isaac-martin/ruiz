Marketing is just sales, right? Erm... no, not quite. Marketing isn’t just sales. But then, what’s the difference? Isn’t marketing just moving product?

To break it down simply, marketing is everything you do to reach and eventually convert prospects, while sales is solely the process of converting prospects. Basically, sales is the home stretch of the marketing process.

There are a few other points that differentiate sales and marketing which we’ve outlined below:

* Sales takes a product that already exists and making a market for it
* Marketing consists of looking at a market and creating a product that will fit
* If the market isn’t ready for a product, then marketing includes innovating to create something that meets consumers’ needs and wants
* Marketing includes looking at positioning and understanding market fit
* Marketing encompasses creating a lasting relationship between a consumer and brand
